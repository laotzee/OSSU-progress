> Programming is about managing complexity in a way that facilitates change. There are two powerful mechanisms available for accomplishing this: decomposition and abstraction.


> The essence of programming as a process not of writing individual lines od code, but of composing abstractions.

Overloding:

> Good programmers design their programs so as to minimize the amount of code that might need to be changed when changes are needed.

Encapsulation:

Information Hiding: Being one of the keys to modularity.

> Follow the sensible rule of not directly accesing data attributes from outside the class in which they are defined. 

Yield statement: any function definition containing a field statement is treated in a special way. The presence of yield tells the Pythonn system that the function is a generator. Generators are typically used in conjuntion with for statements. 

What are generators?
