*Whenever you write a loop, you should think about an **appropriate decrementing function***.

# Terminology
- Guess and check algorithms
- Exhaustive enumeration: Enumeration of all possibilities until we get to the right answer or exhaust the space of possibilities. *in many cases, they run fast enough for all practical purposes. Even thought it might seem dumb*
- Bisection Search

# String Manipulation
- Strings allow indexing
- Allow *slicing* `string[start:stop:step]`
	- For going backwards `string[::-1]`
- Strings are *immutable*, once created cannot be modify.
