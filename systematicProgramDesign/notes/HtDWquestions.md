**What are the phases into world program design is divided into?** (1) Domain Analysis (2) Build the actual program
**What are the parts of a domain analysis?** (1) Sketch program scenarios (2) Identify constant information (3) identify changing information (4) Identify big-bang options
**What are the part of building a program?** (1) Creation of constants (2) Data definitions using HtDD (3) Functions using HtDF; main first and then create a wish list entry for big bang handlers (4) Work through wish list until done
**What is a wish list in the context of a program?** A wish list is a list of a features that are not implemented yet into the program. 
**How is the recommended way of creating a domain analysis?** A domain analysis is best done by hand, drawing at least 3 scenarios of the program, which in turn would make easier stablishing constants and changing information.
**What are some examples of changing information?** Examples of changing information might be (1) the position of an object (2) the value of a health bar (3) elements on a inventory
**What are some examples of constant information?** Examples of constant information might be (1) height and width of a window (2) color of a background (3) the image of the object (4) the color of the health bar
**What is the process of building a program according to HtDW guide?** (1) First it's presented a short summary of the program's behaviour (2) The next section defines the constants, which typically come from the identification of constants (3) The world state, which is the changing information identified during the analysis, is represented by the data definition. More complex programs will have more than one definition. (4) Finally the creation of function, which starts by the main function. After that, the wish list of functions if organized by importance, besides keeping together closely related functions.
**How a wish list is created?** For each of the functions, it's created a signature, purpose and a stub, alongside a marker such as '!!!' that is easy to search for.
**What does it mean polymorphism?** The term polymorphism refers to the ability of an object or function to have multiple forms or behaviours. 
**What differences people who code from program designers?** The fact that the program has an analysis or model, which is then used as a guide for the implementation of the program.
