**What is compound data?** Compound data is used when two values naturally belong together, as a certain position with two coordinates (x, y)
**How is the recipe for creating compound data?** The creation of a compound data data follows the same recipe as the one for atomic data, but at the beginning a define-struct with the proper arguments for the data. 
**After the creation of the compound data template, how can we create an instance?** Once the define-struct is in place, to create an instrance is needed to call define plus the name of the struct, along side the proper arguments
**How much does compound data differ from atomic data?** Not much, besides being two arguements instead of one and having different templates.
**What is a helper function?** A helper function perform some part of the computation of other functions
**What is the use of a helper function?** They help the main function look more clean, precise and readable by giving descriptive names to some of the computations invovled. They can also be use anywhere in the program, thus, enhancing the reusability of code.
