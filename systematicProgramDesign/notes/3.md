# Notes on HtDF

- Design is the process of going from a poorly formed problem to a well structure solution



## Tests and Examples 

Thinking of a new casae, or a new subtlety part way through the design is common. When it happens:
- Write an example (test) right away
- Update all affected parts of design often this involves purpose and/or function definition
- It sometimes involves existing tests of even the signature

- Stub, examples, templates and assertions all are erased after they complete their purpose.
