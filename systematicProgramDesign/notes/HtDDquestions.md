**What is the first most important aspect of how to design data?** The structure of the information in the program's domain determines the kind of data definition used
**How does the data definition affects the program?** Data definitions determine the structure of the template and helps set funcion examples.
**What is the importance of modeling information into the program as a data definition?** Its importances derives from the fact that it determines the structure of much of the final program design
**What is simple atomic data?** Simple atomic data is represented in a way that cannot be divided. Examples can be a coordinate, a name, or a boolean value
**When intervals are used as a data definition?** Use an interval when the information to be represented is numbers within a certain range
**What are some examples of some atomic non-distinct type of data?** Some examples might be (1) Numbers (2) Strings (3) Intervals (4) Booleans
**What are some examples of some atomic distinc values?** Some examples might be (1) 'red' (2) False (3) 34.4
**What kind of data is describe as itemizations?** The itemization describes data comprised of 2 or more subclasses (atomic non-distinc and distinc values), at least one of which is not a distinc item. Ex, would be to have number and the boolean value 'False'.
**What is the a problem domain?** It refers to the area or subject matter in which a problem exists. It defines the scope and boundaries of a problem that needs to be solved or addressed. It includes all the relevant entities, concepts, rules, constraints, and interactions related to the problem. Identifying and understanding the domain problem is crucial in order to develop effectiver solutions or strategies to solve the problem. 
**What are the four things a data definition describes?** (1) how to form data of a new type (2) how to represent information as data (3) how to interpret data as information (4) the template for operating on the data
